            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>Introduction:</b><br>Bravenet is the number one provider of free web tools in the world, and 
ranked among the top 50 visited websites worldwide! More than 6 million 
registered members enjoy Bravenet services, and over 20 million unique visitors 
access a Bravenet product each month.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;">Best of all, 
            Bravenet´s Affiliate Program rewards webmasters like you with $1 
            for each free active member you submit to their community, with 
            more than 6 million registered members you can trust on Bravenet´s 
            Affiliate Program.<br>Please </span></font><a href="http://www.bravenet.com/?afilid=384752304" target="_blank"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><font face="Arial" color="red"><b>Click 
            Here</b></font></span></a><font face="Arial" color="red"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b> 
            </b></span></font><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;">to 
            signup and register yourself as a new afiliate, this is needed to 
            get your affiliate ID and use B.I.A.B.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>The Box</b><br>Here 
            is where B.I.A.B. comes.<br>As a Bravenet Affiliate, you 
            have the option to add their banners and/or text links to your site 
            in order to refer new members, but B.I.A.B. goes one step 
            ahead:<br>By unzipping and uploading the B.I.A.B. package 
            to your own server, you can offer their web tools from your own 
            website, giving visitors the option to register the Bravenet´s services 
            directly from your website, by passing your own Bravenet Affiliate 
            Code in the submitted&nbsp;form in order to receive the credit for 
            this signup.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;">Banners and 
            text links based on cookies are not 100% effective depending in 
            the user´s browser configuration, so refering a visitor to an external 
            website through an affiliate link does not guarantee&nbsp;you will 
            receive the credit for this signup. We know Bravenet tracks them 
            in a very efficient way, but once more, this way is not absolutely 
            safe to be&nbsp;credited for your referrals.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;">Because B.I.A.B. 
            is a transparent pack that shows your visitors most of the resources 
            available at Bravenet´s &nbsp;website, it doesn't redirect your 
            visitor to their website directly, in fact it offers your guests 
            to signup through your affiliate ID from your own website. This 
            way, you are rewarded with every  signup refered earning $1 for 
            each of them that becomes a free active user It also gives you a professional looking 
            website and more traffic to come.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>Setup Instructions:</b><br>Setting 
            B.I.A.B. is pretty easy.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;">1- First of 
            all, you need to be a Bravenet Affiliate, if not yet, please </span></font><a href="http://www.bravenet.com/?afilid=384752304" target="_blank"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><font face="Arial" color="red"><b>Click 
            Here</b></font></span></a><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;"> 
            to signup and register yourself as a new afiliate ( click &quot;Register 
            for the&nbsp;Affiliate Program&quot; after login)</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;">2- This package 
            comes in a zip format, so just unzip it to your local hard disk. <br>
            A new folder called &quot;webtools&quot; will be unzipped containing 
            the necessary files to be edited and uploaded.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;">3- Within the 
            &quot;webtools&quot; folder, find a file called &quot;config.php&quot;. 
            Open it using a text editor, like notepad, and change the $aff value 
            to match your own Bravenet´s Affiliate ID. <br>For example, if your 
            affiliate code given is something like: http://www.bravenet.com/cserv.php?pid=4&amp;tid=2&amp;<b>afilid=123456789</b>&nbsp;means 
            that&nbsp;your affiliate ID is: <b>123456789.</b> <br>Then, put this &quot;123456789&quot; 
            value in the config.php and save it. </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;">It should look 
            like <br><b>$aff = &quot;123456789&quot;; </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dont 
            forget the double quotes and the semicolon at the end of the line, 
            or it will not work properly.<br>That´s it</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;">4- Last step 
            is to upload the full package to your web server using a FTP program 
            keeping the file structure to a new folder, say &quot;webtools&quot;, 
            in your root directory. After uploaded, just point your browser 
            to http://www.yourdomain.com/webtools and you are ready to go.<br><b>Note:</b> 
            Be sure to upload all the files in the &quot;images&quot; folder 
            in binary format, and all *.php and *.html inASCII</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;">5- The pack 
            comes with an easy to edit header and footer files that will help 
            you to match your current layout.<br>Just edit header.html and footer.html 
            with your favorite HTML editor and replace the ones in your server.<br> 
            If you want to change the hyperlinks colors (green by default) just 
            open header.html and replace the styles color values to mach your 
            site. <br>This pack also comes with a custom thankyou.php page that 
            is launched after the signup form submitted. Feel free to edit this page 
            as you want but be sure to save it in your server with the exact 
            &quot;thankyou.php&quot; filename or it will fail to load  after 
            submitted. Anyway, you can always redirect this page to another 
            one by adding a meta refresh parameter after &nbsp;the &lt;head&gt; 
            tag, like this: </span></font></p>
<span style="font-size:10pt;"><font face="Arial">&lt;?php<BR>include(&quot;config.php&quot;);<BR>include(&quot;header.html&quot;);<BR>?&gt;<br>&lt;html&gt; <br>&lt;head&gt; <br>&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; 
            content=&quot;0;url=http://www.yahoo.com&quot;&gt; <br>&lt;/head&gt; 
            <br>&lt;body&gt; <br>&lt;/body&gt; <br>&lt;/html&gt;</font></span>
            <p><span style="font-size:10pt;"><font face="Arial">&lt;?php<BR>include(&quot;footer.html&quot;);<BR>?&gt;</font></span>            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;">Pasting the 
            above code to replace the current one located at the&nbsp;&quot;thankyou.php&quot; 
            file will make the form to reach the thankyou page , then it will 
            automatically redirects the visitor to yahoo.com (change the yahoo´s 
            URL with yours, of course)</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;">You are all 
            set.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt;">6- Promote your 
            new &nbsp;WebTools pages through your members and visitors, and start 
            earning from Bravenet´s Affiliate Program. Payments are made once 
            per month like a clock, and don't forget  to check the affiliate program
