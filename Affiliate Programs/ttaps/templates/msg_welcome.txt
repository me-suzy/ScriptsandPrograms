Dear [name],

In order to start referring to our site, you have to use one or more links

=================================================

Please visit the support pages at:

You can change your personal data there also.

Click on this link to generate your affiliate HTML code:

==================================================

You can use any kind of link you want (almost). 

Make sure its syntax is correct.

Check it by setting your browser to 'accept cookies, but notify', and click on 
the link. You should get a cookie with your ID as a value. Opera, Netscape and
Explorer allow this, under the 'options' or 'settings' heading.

Don't send email spam or mislead people. 

No UseNet cross-postings. No guestbook or message board spam; put the link in your 
signature instead.

I hope we can make a lot of money together.
