Hello,

As of 27-Jul-05 RockOutMedia made a deal with the programmer of
 MySpaceContactScript.tk Mark Beard. Rock out Media operates the 
Site on witch MySpaceContactScript.tk is now hosted Mark Beard 
Is still the lead programmer of the project. They agreed to change
the name from MySpaceCotactScript.tk to MySpace Contact Script
hosted on MySpaceOutFit.com. This officaly takes effect Aug 10,2005
at 12:01 am.I hope this has not caused any problems for anyone. 
There have only been two major changes to the script.I would strongly 
suggest you download the latest release as some of the script contacts
the old location of the script to check for updates. The old location 
will be taken offline within the next month.
Thank You,

Mark Beard
MySpace Contact Script Lead Devloper/
