    Table of date codes for formatting the
    date for display by The Verbosifier.

=============================================

Use these codes to format the date as you like. If you want to use a plain
word (like 'of' or 'the') you must escape each letter of the word with a
backslash ('\o\f' and '\t\h\e').
For example, to get "Saturday, the 22nd of October, 2005" you would enter
        l, \t\h\e jS \o\f F, Y

YEAR:
    Y: 2005
    y: 05
MONTH:
    n: 4 (as one or two digits)
    m: 04 (as two digits)
    F: April
    M: Apr
DAY OF THE YEAR:
    z: 0-365
DAY OF THE MONTH:
    S: st/nd/rd/th (two-digit ordinal suffix [e.g. 1st of...])
    j: 9 (one or two digits)
    d: 09 (two digits)
    t: 28-31 (number of days in given month)
DAY OF THE WEEK:
    l (small L): Monday
    D: Mon
    w: 0-6 (0 is Sunday)
HOUR:
    g: 7 (12-hour format with one or two digits)
    G: 19 (24-hour format with two digits)
    h: 07 (12-hour format with one or two digits)
    H: 19 (24-hour format with two digits)
MISC TIME:
    i: 45 (minutes)
    a: am/pm
    A: AM/PM
    s: 12 (seconds)
    U: 1129596111 (seconds since the 1st of January, 1970.)

It's always better to show the year as four digits and the month as three letters
because it reduces confusion: lots of people have trouble with an ambiguous date
like 06-10-05 because it can be construed as:
    - 6th of October, 2005 (DMY, mainly British)
    - October the 10th, 2005 (MDY, mainly American)
    - 2006, October the 5th (YMD, Zulu (international date/time))
    - 2006, 10th of May (YDM, a rare variation of Zulu)
