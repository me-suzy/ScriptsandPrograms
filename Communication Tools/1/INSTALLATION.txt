For installation, extract ZIP into a folder and include comment.php into the file you want comments to be written to. Make sure in the .mdb that you describe the page identifier so that the script knows which comments belong to which pages. Currently there is no administrative login so make changes to the Admin/Banned table as needed. For visual changes modify the clean.css file.

Please disregard the below information as this script is still a WIP. The password to the comment.mdb is currently set to 'test' with the username as 'Admin'.
