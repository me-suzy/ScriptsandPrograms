		<p><span class="sub2"><a name="licence"></a>Licence</span><br />
		By using Particle Wiki you show you have read and agree to the licence and terms of use. You can find them <strong><a href="licence.htm">here</a></strong>. It is worth noting that although Particle Wiki may be free it is not open source.</p>
		
		<p><span class="sub2"><a name="licence"></a>Requirements</span><br />
		Here contains information on what you will need to run the script.</p>
		<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
		<p><strong><a name="isrequired"></a>What is required</strong><br />
		You will need the following things:<br />
		&#8226; PHP - the script is written in the <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> language - tested with 4.x<br />
		&#8226; MySQL - currently only <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> databases are supported
		<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
		<p><strong><a name="isntrequired"></a>What isn't required</strong><br />
		Things that you will not need:<br />
		&#8226; Linux - the script has been tested on Windows and should run on all servers<br />
		&#8226; Apache - Particle Wiki works fine on IIS and should do no other software</p>
		<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
		
		<p><span class="sub2"><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</span><br />
		Installing the script is pretty simple. This section will guide you through the steps to have your blog up and running in minutes.
		<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
		<p><strong><a name="dbconfig"></a>Database configuration</strong><br />
		In order to install the script you will need to create a MySQL database and a user which has permissions to access this database.</p>
		<p>Once you have these, open up includes/config.php. Here you will need to enter your information. Usually you should be able to leave $dbhost and $dbprefix as default. You don't need to change these unless you know what your doing.</p>
		<p>You will however need to change:</p>
		<p>$dbuser = "";<br />
		$dbpass = "";<br />
		$dbname = "";</p>
		<p>Enter the name of your database into $dbname such as $dbname = "mydatabase";. You also need to enter the username for the user who can access this database into $dbuser and the password for that user into $dbpass.</p>
		<p>Once you have entered these values, save config.php and upload it to your web server. You may want to remove write permissions to it so that you do not overwrite it in future (although make sure it still has read permissions so the script can read it!).</p>
		<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
		<p><strong><a name="installer"></a>Running the installer</strong><br />
		Once you have uploaded the file you can access the installer and run the script:</p>
		<p><a href="install/install.php">install/install.php</a></p>
		<p>If you are reading this on the website you will be able to click the above link but if not simply type the address into your web browser. The installer will then take you through each step.</p>
		<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
		<p><strong><a name="installfolder"></a>Delete /install/</strong><br />
		For security reasons, once you have run the installer you will need to delete the install folder from the web server. Do it. Do it now!</p>
		<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
		
		<p><span class="sub2"><a name="userguide"></a>User Guide</span><br />
		Here is a quick guide on how to use and admin the scipt.
		<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
		<p><strong><a name="adminpanel"></a>Admin Panel</strong><br />
		You can reach the admin panel by goign to admin.php from your homepage. You will then be asked to log in using the username and password you choosen when installing the script. Once you have logged in you will be taken to the configuration page. You can update your password and details by clicking on the my account page.</p>
		<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
		<p><strong><a name="config"></a>Configuration</strong><br />
		From here you can alter the various configuration settings of the script. Each one is simply a text box so make sure that you enter the correct value. There is an explanation of each one next to each other and usually an example of the default value in case you need to reset it.</p>
		<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
		<p><strong><a name="editing"></a>Editing Pages</strong><br />
		Back on the subject of the regular pages. If you are on a wiki page you can click edit to open the page source in a text box. You can edit the page here and once your done click preview to test it or save page to save the new copy. Also use the text box below to explain what you are changing for the history. An explanation of how to edit is below the text box.</p>
		<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
		<p><strong><a name="history"></a>Page History</strong><br />
		Each time you save the page a new copy is created and all the other copies are archived. You can go into the history page and click the date to see a copy of that page. You can also revert back to that copy of the page by selecting the radio button and clicking the revert button at the bottom.</p>
		<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
		<p><strong><a name="skins"></a>Skins</strong><br />
		The default skin for Particle Wiki is ParticleBlue. However the script also ships with several other skins. These Are based on the ParticleBlue templates though so ParticleBlue must be still there while using the other skins. Alternatively you can copy all the missing files into the folder. Also feel free to develop your own skins and submit them on the forums.</p>
