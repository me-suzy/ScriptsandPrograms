	   Jodchat Installation Instructions
---------------------------------------------

Thankyou for choosing Jodchat.

To run jodchat, just upload these following files:
 * jodchat.php
 * jodchat_conf.php
 * chat_template.htm
 * chat_messages.txt

If your a unix or a posix based system e.g. linux, you'll need to make sure "chat_messages.txt"'s permissions is set to read and write e.g. 0666.
 
Now goto your jodchat program e.g :

http://www.your-site/exampledirectory/jodchat.php

And it should run!! - simple as that.

By default you'll get a white screen. However, you can change the look of your chatroom by editing the "chat_template.htm" file. If you look at the code you'll see the string "$chat$" - where ever the "$chat$" is, will be where your chatroom will appear. So its import to make sure "$chat$" is included in this file.

If you want access to the moderator functions you'll need to edit your "jodchat_conf.php" file. First of all you'll need change the password to something only you'll know e.g.:

$moderator_password = "mysecretpassword";

And Secondly you'll need to enable the functions you want to use e.g.:

$moderator_bomb = true;
$moderator_kick = true;

To use these moderator functions in the chatroom type the following in the chatroom send box:

#kick moderator_password username
(this will kick user "username" off your chat room)

And...

#bomb moderator_password username
(this will crash user "username"'s  browser - completely harmless but should get the message across!!)

And finally you can change at what rate your browser checks for new messages, by changing modifying the "$check_rate" variable e.g.

$check_rate = 2;
(this will make your browser check for new massages every 2 seconds)

$check_rate = 5;
(this will make your browser check for new massages every 5 seconds)

Have fun!!

Jody
