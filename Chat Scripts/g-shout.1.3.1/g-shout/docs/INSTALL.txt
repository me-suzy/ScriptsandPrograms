HOW TO INSTALL
======================

A. Without installation wizard

#  UPLOAD

1. Upload all files. Use ASCII mode for all files except all image files (.gif|.jpg) inside 'images' directory using BINARY.
2. Rename config_bak.php file to become config.php


#  WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!
#  CHANGE THE NAME OF THE DIRECTORY CONTAINS .dat and .log file (default is _secret)

3. For security reason, you MUST rename the directory '_secret' to something hard to be guessed.
   It will be better if you change default.dat and default.log name (inside '_secret' dir) to something hard too.
   example: directory '_secret' becomes '_you_dont_know'
            file default.dat becomes what_is.dat
	    file default.log becomes my_log.log

   And then open config.php and find these codes (they are called variables)
   $secret_dir = "_secret";
   $database = "default.dat";
   $log = "default.log";

   change them with your new name:
   $secret_dir = "_you_dont_know";
   $database = "what_is.dat";
   $log = "my_log.log";
   (please use your own ideas)


#  CHANGE THE 3 FILES's PERMISSION TO WRITEABLE

4. CHMOD 666 config.php
5. go to your new secret directory and CHMOD 666 what_is.dat (depend on your new data file's name)
6. and CHMOD 666 my_log.log



#  SETTING PASSWORD AND SECRET QUESTION/ANSWER

7. open config.php with text file editor and find this code:
   $admin_password = "gshout";
   this is your password to login.
   change to:
   $admin_password = "YourNewPassWord";

8. change this codes:
   $secret_question = "Who is the author from this script??";
   $secret_answer = "donie";
   
   to: 
   $secret_question = "What is that?";
   $secret_answer = "idontknow";



#  CHECKING

9. Run install.php script from you browser, use http://your.site.com/path/to/g-shout/install.php
   If you find red text there, it means you still missing that configuration for checking.
