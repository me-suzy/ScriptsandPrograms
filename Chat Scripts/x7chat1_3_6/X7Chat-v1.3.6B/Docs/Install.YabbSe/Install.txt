Installation as a YabbSe Module
 To install X7 Chat you must have PHP Version 4+ and MySql Version 3+.
 After making sure that you have the correct versions of PHP and MySql
 please follow the following steps.
 
 1) Open the file config.php in a text editor.  Scroll down past the
    copyright.  There you will see 10 variables that need edited.  The
    variables are in the form $VARIABLENAME[SUBNAME] = "VALUE";  You
    will need to replace the current value of a variable with the 
    correct value for your server.  I recommend setting the 
    $SERVER['PATH'] variable to "/" unless you experience problems.
    You MUST set the $SERVER['AUTH'] variable to "yabbse".
    
 2) Upload all of the included files, except the Docs directory to
    the server.  Upload all files in binary mode (usually default).
    After you upload all files CHMOD 777 the directory Logs.
	
    WARNING: The X7 Chat directory MUST be directly inside the YabbSe directory.
    
 3) After uploading all the files to the server go to
    http://yoursite.com/yabbsedir/x7chatdirectory/install.php.  
    After going to the install.php page you will be guided through
    setup.  The admin account you create in install must have the SAME username
    and password (for verification) as your admin account for YabbSe.
    
 4) After finishing the online setup delete the file install.php.  If
    you do not it will be possible for anyone to create an administrator
    account on your chat server.

 5) Now we need to add a link to the chat room.  Enter the YabbSe Admin panel
    and click on Edit your Forum Template under the Forum Configuration section.
    In the large text box find:
    ---------------------------------------------------
    <yabb menu>
    ---------------------------------------------------

    And after it add:
    ---------------------------------------------------
    <a href="/X7Chat"><img src="chat.gif" alt="Chat" border="0" /></a>
    ---------------------------------------------------
    In the above code you will need to replace /X7Chat with the name of your X7 Chat directory.
    You will also need to create a button to match your menu buttons and then upload it.  Now replace
    the chat.gif in the above code with the URL of your new image.

 6) All finished :)  Have fun chatting, you need help with the install check out
    the online forum at our website, http://forum.x7chat.com/.

 7) NOTES AND TIPS ON RUNNING X7 CHAT AS AN YabbSe MOD:
      A) The User Manager in the X7 Chat admin panel will not work, use the one
	 included with YabbSe.
		 
      B) I STRONGLY recommend disabling registration on X7 Chat since all registration MUST
	 take place through the YabbSe registration form or else X7 Chat will not
	 work correctly.
