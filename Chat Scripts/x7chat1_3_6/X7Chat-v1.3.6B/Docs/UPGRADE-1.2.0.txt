Upgrading from 1.2.0 to 1.3.X
 This file will guide you through upgrading from X7 Chat version 1.2.0
 to X7 Chat 1.3.X, If you already have Version 1.3.X DO NOT FOLLOW THESE
 DIRECTIONS, see the file UPDATE-1.3.0.txt!
 
 1) Open the file config.php in a text editor.  Scroll down past the
    copyright.  There you will see 10 variables that need edited.  The
    variables are in the form $VARIABLENAME[SUBNAME] = "VALUE";  You
    will need to replace the current value of a variable with the 
    correct value for your server.  At the end of this file is a long
	explanation for each of theses variables.
    
 2) After editing the file config.php with the correct variables,
    upload all of the included files except for the Docs directory 
	and install.php.  MAKE SURE YOU UPLOAD ALL FILES IN BINARY MODE!
	If you do not upload all files in binary mode then X7 Chat will not
    work correctly.  Make sure all old files are deleted and that the
	new files included in this download replace them.    After you upload 
	all files CHMOD 777 the directory Logs.  
    
 3) After uploading all the files to the server go to
    http://yoursite.com/x7chatdirectory/upgrade.php.  Make sure you
    replace yoursite.com with the correct domain name and
    x7chatdirectory with the directory that you uploaded X7 Chat to.
    After going to the upgrade.php page the new MySql tables will be
	installed and the upgrade will be complete.
    
 4) After finishing the online setup delete the file upgrade.php.  While
    it is not as critical to delete upgrade.php as it is to delete
	install.php its still a good idea to remove it.  You will not need
	it to operate X7 Chat.
    
 5) Have fun chatting!  The upgrade is done!      

 -- Explanation of Variables --
 
Note: All variables ARE case sensitive.
 
$DATABASE['HOST']		:	This is the domain name or IP address of the
						MySql server.  99.9% of the time this is left
						as localhost.  Only change it if you know that
						you are using a remote MySql server.
						
$DATABASE['USER']		:	This is the username that you use to connect
						to the MySql server.  Make sure that the user
						has permissions to access the database you
						will be using.
						
$DATABASE['PASS']		:	This is the password that you use to connect
						to the MySql server.  Make sure you are
						using the correct password, or else X7 Chat
						will not work (duh!)
						
$DATABASE['DATABASE']	:	This is the name of the database that you
						will be using for X7 Chat.
						
$DATABASE['TYPE']		:	You must leave this as MySql.  The only
						reason that it is even in the config file is
						that in future versions different types of
						databases may be supported.  However, as of
						Jan. 5, 2004 only MySql is supported.
						
$SERVER['NAME']			:	This may be equal to whatever you would like
						it to equal.  It serves no real function in the
						script except that it is displayed to users when
						they are chatting.
						
$SERVER['TBL_PREFIX']	:	This allows you to run several copys of
						X7 Chat on one database.  This variable is
						used as a prefix for the table names.  This one
						may be left as default if you are only running
						one copy of X7 Chat.
						
$SERVER['PATH']			:	This is a VERY important variable.  It MUST
						be the URL to your script RELATIVE to the root 
						domain.  For more information on this variable see
						the end of the file.
						
$SERVER['LANGUAGE']		:	This is the language your chat is run in.  As
						of release only "english" is supported.  Hopefully
						some people will be kind enough to translate it
						for us.
						
$SERVER['AUTH']			:	This is the Authentication file that is used when
						a user logs in.  It controls encrypting of passwords
						and getting the password from the database.  You may
						choose between plain (plain text) and md5 (encrypted).
						If you are upgrading from 1.2.0 you MUST choose plain.
						
-- Additional Information on $SERVER['PATH'] --
This section was included becuase so many people had trouble getting
this variable set up correctly.  

First I will start off by explaining what "URL of the script RELATIVE 
to the root domain" means.  The URL to the script is most likly something
like  "http://yoursite.com/Chatroom/".  In this URL the root domain is
"http://yoursite.com" and the PATH is "/Chatroom".
