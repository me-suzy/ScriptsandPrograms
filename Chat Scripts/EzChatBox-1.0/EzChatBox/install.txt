#2 I will now explain some of the options

Area 1 is for configuring the location of EzChatBox this should be 
relative to the file running the application and should not include 
trailing slashes.

Area 2 is for the page titles. These will appear as the browser title
$EZChat_title is the main title on the opening page
$EZChat_ban_title is the title displayed to a user who is banned
$EZChat_up_title is displayed whilst the message is being saved

Area 3 is where for setting the logo displayed whilst on the main
page, whether the tagline is displayed inder the logo and the text
for the tagline.

Area 4 sets whether the html file is set up or whether EzChatBox is 
included in part of a file. For example;
if $EZChat_html = Yes then the file will display the html page set up.
if $EZChat_html = No then EzChatBox will be displayed in a div.

Area 5 sets the page refresh, if yes is turned on then the page will 
reset every 30 seconds. Change the time to suit your refresh requirements.
$EZChat_stringLength sets the maximum characters in a message. Default is 
120.

Area 6 sets the page refresh for the upload page, the default is 3 
seconds. This sets the time (in seconds) that the page holds on uploading 
data page.

Area 7 sets the timezone difference of your site to the server clock.

Area 8 is the administration email address, this is shown to banned 
users if they want to email to plead their case

Area 9 controls the filenames that are accessed for the chat system.
$EZChat_file_ban is the file that banned users IP's are stored in
$EZChat_file_ips is where the messages and IP's are stored for users
$EZChat_file_content is where the users messages are stored. This is 
what is displayed to the users when they are viewing messages.
$EZChat_ban_relocate is the file that banned users will see when they 
try to post a message
