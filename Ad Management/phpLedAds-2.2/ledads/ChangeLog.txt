phpLedAds 2.x ChangeLog -- Jon Coulter (support@ledscripts.com)

2.2 - 2/26/2003, 12/30/2003
  - Fixed getcwd() mistake (use dirname(__FILE__) instead)
  - Fixed implode() error (related to above)
  - Fixed pass-by-reference error on some php's
  - Added past 30-days graph
  - Seperated the config from the common data
    You still edit config.inc.php, though
  - Added feature to check for updates
  - Upgraded to JpGraph 1.11 and fixed code to conform to the new API
  - Removed menu when the window open to show the graphs
  - Added Popup notice when rebuilding graphs
  - Added (by very popular request) a display_unique option
    This allows you to call $pla_class->adcode() multiple times within
    the same document and it will attempt to display unique ads
  - Used $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_*'] variables instead of relying on the globals
    This means that php 4.1 or newer is needed, too
  - Nothing should rely on global variables anymore (if it does, contact me and let me know)
  - Added rich_click.php to track the clicks of rich-media ads,
    See readme for usage
  - A few other cosmetic changes
	
2.1 
  - Just some fixes, not released.
