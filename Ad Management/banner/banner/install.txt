hey, thanks for downloading my script.. its what i love doing-

anyways- firstly this is distributed under GPL license see LICENSE file for more details -

check out http://scripts.maxersmix.com for more updates and other scripts.

anyways.. i thought this didnt need a admin area as phpmyadmin could do all the work. so to install setup a database on your mysql server and then goto banners.php and edit the connection details with your server- login and pass and the name of the db..

then run this sql in phpmyadmin

CREATE TABLE `banners` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `banner` varchar(180) NOT NULL default '',
  `link` varchar(180) NOT NULL default '',
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) TYPE=MyISAM;
        

then add a few banners using phpmyadmin then drop this html into you pages

<script src="http://PATHTOFILE/banners.php"></script>

change this url to wherever you have put the file on your server.
