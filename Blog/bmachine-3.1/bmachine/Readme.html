<h2>Overview</h2>
boastMachine is a robust publishing platform developed in PHP, the world's most powerful scripting language and 
and backed by MySQL (database). boastMachine makes your publishing so fun and easy as never before ! 
From one click installation to advanced Spam management features, boastMachine is loaded with everything that 
enables you to publish your contents with easy !

<br /><br /><br />
<h2>Requirements</h2>
PHP v4.1 or higher, MySQL v3.2 or better

<br /><br /><br />
<h2>Installation</h2>
boastMachine's installation is guaranteed to be done right in 10 minutes or less.<br />
Follow these simple steps to install and start using boastMachine.<br />
<br />

(If you are upgrading from boastMachine 3.0 to 3.1, <a href="#upgrade">click here</a> for upgrade info)<br /><br />

<strong>1</strong>. Extract the package into a directory on your local pc<br />
<strong>2</strong>. Upload the directory to your webserver preserving the file structure<br />
eg: /blog on your site where the .php files and directories come directly under the /blog directory
<br /><br />

<strong>3</strong>. Goto yoursite.com/blog/bmc/install.php and enter the details and hit 'Continue' button<br />
The installation script will ask you for the MySQL info and a username and password for the default admin. 
There'll be three other options<br />
<strong>a)</strong> Autoset directory permissions ( the script will automatically try to set the necessary file and permissions) <br />
<strong>b)</strong> Overwrite tables ( Will overwrite the MySQL tables if you already have an installation)<br />
<strong>c)</strong> Create a new database ( Will try to create a new database with the name you entered)

<br /><br /><br />

Done! Thats all! Now you can access the admin by going to http://yoursite.com/blog/bmc/admin.php<br /><br />

The first thing you should do after the installation is to configure your blog by going to Admin - > Settings

<br /><br /><br />
PS: The 'Autoset Permission' feature will most probably fail because of certain serverside configurations.
In that case, you should set the permissions (CHMOD) by yourself.
/blog/ - 777 (Parent directory)<br />
/blog/backup - 777<br />
/blog/files - 777<br />
/blog/templates - 777<br />
/blog/rss - 777<br />
/blog/bmc/inc/lang - 777<br />
/blog/bmc/inc/vars - 777<br />
/blog/bmc/inc/vars/cache - 777<br />
(assuming that /blog is the parent directory)<br /><br />
Also, if you want to be able to edit the templates online with the template editor, you should CHMOD the appropriate theme directory and all the files in it to 777
<br /><br />
Notes: It is recommended that you delete the install script (install.php) manually after the installation for extra security.

<br /><br /><br />
<h2>Search engine friendly urls</h2>
The all new boastMachine brings to you what no other blog can ! The new boastMachine 
has the ability to use search engine friendly URLs by default without needing any 
extra modding or hacking ! Your log entry urls no more look like this http://site.com/blog/blog_name.php?id=25 but
http://site.com/blog/my-post-title-25-1.html . Now how is that! You didnt expect that, did you?<br /><br />

<br /><br /><br />
<h2>a ShoutBox !</h2>
Yes, boastMachine has a built in shoutbox system!<br />
This nifty built in shoutbox doesn't use a MySQL db.
You can display this shoutbox on any of the boastMachine pages.
The function you should use to load the shoubox is bmc_ShoutBox();
For example, in a template, it would look something like this.<br /><br />
<strong><code>&lt;?php bmc_ShoutBox(); ?&gt;</code></strong><br />

<br /><br /><br />
<h2>ALT+U</h2>
Now what is that! boastMachine comes with a nifty little menu :) Once you are logged in, 
hitting the key combination ALT+U will make a floating menu popup. You'll find quick links 
to your account, posts etc. Hit ALT+U again and the box is gone! How nifty is that?
<br />

<br /><br /><br />
<h2>AntiSpam</h2>
boastMachine is loaded with advanced spam fighting features that drastically minimizes spam on your blogs. 
Image verification on comments help to prevent automated bots from commenting. The keyword trigger enables you to 
block and ban the users posting comments and trackbacks containing specific keywords.

<br /><br /><br />
<h2>User Levels</h2>
boastMachine has 5 different user levels, ranging from 0 to 4<br />
Each level has certain privilages. Here's a list of them<br /><br />

0 - Frozen/Disabled. No rights<br />
1 - Can post comments<br />
2 - Can post comments and new posts<br />
3 - Can post/edit posts and comments<br />
4 - ADMINISTRATOR. Full privilages. Access to admin panel<br />

<h2>Upgrading from 3.0 to 3.1</h2>

which can be found in the package itself (upgrade.3.1.zip) or can be downloaded from <a href="http://boastology.com/pages/dload.php?id=upgrade.3.1">here</a>. The exact installation &amp; upgrade 
procedure can be found in the readme of the upgrade script.
