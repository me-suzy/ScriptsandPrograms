ChangeLog ::
See CHANGELOG.txt for a history of changes and known issues

History of the Project ::
See HISTORY.txt for background on this project

Installation ::
1. Upload everything to a directory in the document root of your 
webserver.  If the URL of your website is http://example.com and you 
install wheatblog in a directory called "blog," then the URL to your blog 
will be http://example.com/blog/  

2. Change permissions on rss.xml to 777 so that your webserver can write 
to the RSS file (chmod 777 settings.php).  If the rss.xml file does not 
exist in your blog directory, create it (touch rss.xml) and then set its 
permissions.  

3. Edit the settings.php file.  Follow the directions in the comments.    

4. Set up your database.  The necessary SQL can be found in the "tools" 
directory.  Use the appropriate file for your database server 
(wheatblog-mysql.sql for MySQL or wheatblog-sqlite.sql for SQLite).  

  If you are using phpMyAdmin to manage your databases, do the 
  following:
    a. Open wheatblog-mysql.sql in your favorite editor
    b. Delete or comment out the first line and save
    c. Log in to phpMyAdmin, 
    d. Select/create your new database
    e. Click the "SQL" tab, 
    f. Paste the contents of the appropriate SQL file into the 
       "Run SQL query/queries on database" window
    g. Press the "Go" button.  

5. Load your site in a web browser

6. Log into the admin account using the default user (admin) and the 
default password (password).  Select "admin page" for the 
"Administration" menu and "Manage Users" to change your admin username 
and/or password.  

7. Select "add post" from the "Administration" menu and test it out!

Tweaking the CSS ::
wB is CSS driven.  All of the files associated with the templates are in 
the "css" folder and its subfolders (especially the "elem" subfolder).  

Tweaking other aspects of the design ::
wB makes extensive use of headers and footers.  These control many 
global aspects of the application. They can be found in the "includes" 
folder.

about it, there are several resources availible:
