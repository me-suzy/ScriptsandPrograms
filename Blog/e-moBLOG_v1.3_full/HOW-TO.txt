 * 1 // INTRODUCTION //************************************************************/
 
 e-moBLOG is a weblog system basically written for people who searched for a
 complete, powerful, still quite light weblog system.  Why people who want to have
 their own, but easy weblog should be limited to a basic, too simple one?
 
 This system has the necessary options, without having too many. And, of course,
 you only need to set them once. Now, if you need an option which is not
 implemented in this engine, just check the Contact section of this file below and
 send us a mail with your ideas and comments!

 * 3 // MOBILE BLOGGING FEATURE //*************************************************/

 Mobile blogging makes you able to post an article to your blog from almost any
 portable device, such as your mobile phone or PocketPC. Please read notes below
 very carefully before enabling this feature!

 Mobile blogging is quite easy. Here's how it works.

 First, you have to set the options as required in the e-moBLOG admin panel config-
 uration page, which are: a mail server address (i.e. mail.yourdomain.com), the mail
 server port (i.e. 110), a mail server type (either POP3 and IMAP can be used), the
 login for the mail address which will be used on this mail server, as well as the
 corresponding password.

 You also need to specify in the options the *full* ABSOLUTE path to your blog home
 directory, including the last "/" character.
 (i.e.:   /home/yourdomain/public_html/my_blog_home/   )

 And you also need to change the permissions on the e-moBLOG "/attach" directory
 to chmod 777. If you are not doing this, the blog engine will not be able to store
 an attached image to a mobile blogging message sent to your blog.

 The mail address that has to be checked by the blog system is defined by its login
 and password, so it's pretty normal that you don't have to enter the e-mail address
 itself anywhere in the configuration.

 Once you have done this, you may set the mobile blogging option to "enabled". In
 this case, the blog system will automatically check for new mails on the provided
 mail account, process them and display them.

 Please be careful though! The mail address you will be using for mobile blogging
 should be used *exclusively* for that purpose, and for nothing else. Why? Because
 when the e-moBLOG system will check this mail address (this is done automatically
 if you set the mobile blogging option to "enabled") for new messages to add to the
 blog articles, it will process them all and then *delete* them from the server. If
 a mail is not intented to be posted as an article on the blog, it will be deleted
 as well. So I say it again: the mail address you'll be using for mobile blogging
 should *ONLY* be used for that purpose and for no other.

 Also, please note that in order to be displayed, a message sent to the mobile
 blogging mail address needs to meet a few requirements (if not, it will be
 discarded and deleted).

 First, the subject of the message you send MUST end by "@yourblogpassword" where
 "yourblogpassword" is the admin password you chose when you installed e-moBLOG on
 your hosting account. This is just to be sure you're the only one able to post an
 article on your blog using mobile blogging feature.

 Example of message subject:    this is my subject!@mypasswordhere

 Then, I realized that most mobile phone operators were adding their own ads when,
 for example, sending a MMS message to an e-mail address. My operator even adds a
 whole HTML page with ads and commercial messages in this case. This is why when
 you send a message to your mobile blogging e-mail address, you must include your
 article between "£" signs (pound signs) and the blog system will only take care of
 the message part included between those, all the rest (except the subject, of
 course) will be discarded.

 Example of message body:    £here goes my message body, and nowhere else!£

 One last thing: if you enable this feature, the e-moBLOG system will have to esta-
 blish a connection with your IMAP/POP3 e-mail address from time to time. This is
 actually done if a visitor enters the main page of your blog and if it hasn't been
 checked yet during the last 10 minutes. Please note that this could slow down your
 blog a bit for a few seconds every time the system checks for new messages on the
 mail server (depending on the speed of this server).

 IMPORTANT NOTE: As you might see here, posting a plain text article from a mobile
 device using the mobile blogging feature is quite easy. On the development side,
 that feature is easy to implement as well. But posting an article with an attach-
 ment is a much more complex feature to implement. It actually works fine, but is
 a bit limited for now (until I find a way to implement it in a better way):

 If you want to add an attachment to your message (which is not required but could
 be funny - i.e. to send a picture you just took with your mobile phone integrated
 camera, along with a small text) your message should only have *one* attachment,
 and this attachment *must* be a jpeg (.jpg) image. No more than one attachment
 will be processed, and *no other* file or image format will work.

 Also, please note that when I ran some tests during development, I noticed that
 some mobile phones and/or mobile phone operators and/or mail systems were encoding
 the messages in such a way the e-moBLOG mobile blogging feature couldn't read them
 correctly. In those cases, the text was correctly added and displayed to the blog,
 but the attached image was either discarded or unproperly displayed. Sorry then if
 this feature is not working perfectly with your device/operator/software, please
 feel free to drop me a line explaining the error and let me know what you are using
 (device, operator, software, ...). That would help me enhancing the system. Thanks.

 If you carefully read this section, and if you understood every single word of it,
 you're ready to use e-moBLOG's mobile blogging feature!



 * 4 // REQUIREMENTS //************************************************************/
 
 You need a web hosting account, which allow PHP parsing and you must have a
 MySQL database.  The GD library is required too  (version 1.6 or older will
 NOT work, you need a more recent version) if you want to enable the automatic
 image resizing option.  PHP includes a GD library by default since version 4.3.
 
 If the GD library is not installed on your web hosting account, I suggest
 you ask your hosting company if they could install it. It's free and easy.
 
 If it looks like your web hosting account has all of this and the e-moBLOG
 engine still doesn't work, please send us a mail (see Contact section below).
 
 

  * 5 // INSTALLING //*************************************************************/
  
  	a.  Edit the  /includes/db.php  file with a text editor and change the
	    strings to fit your hosting account (you must edit the "your database
	    username",  "your database password" and  "the name of your database"
	    strings). Note: do not delete the quotes ("), leave them!
		
	    Note: the "localhost" string does NOT need to be edited, except if
	    your database is on a separate server (if you don't uderstand this,
	    that probably means you should not edit this string), or if the port
            your MySQL server is using is different from the default one. In this
            case, please read the db.php footnote for more informations.
		
	b.  Upload all the files and subdirectories on your web hosting account.
	    Do  not  change the subdirectories or the file names,  or it probably
	    won't work at all. We recommend uploading the files to a subdirectory
	    of your account, rather than in the root.
		
	c.  Launch your favorite web browser, and go to the following address:
	    http://www.yourdomain.com/blogdirectory/install.php
		
	    Note: replace "www.yourdomain.com" by your domain name or web hosting
	    account URL, and replace "blogdirectory" by the name of the directory
	    on your account where you uploaded the e-moBLOG engine files.
		
	d.  Follow the instructions provided by the install procedure. This will
	    only take a few minutes.  Be careful to fill the configuration form
	    correctly, especially the login and password.  Do NOT loose those, or
	    you won't be able to use your webblog system and would need to do the
	    whole install procedure again.
		
	e.  Connect to your web hosting account and delete the file install.php
	    (do not forget to do this, or anyone accessing this file could reset
	    your blog and change your login and password for the admin section!)

        f.  If you are still connected to your web hosting account and if you plan
            on using e-moBLOG's mobile blogging feature, change your e-moBLOG
            "attach/" directory permissions to chmod 777, then disconnect from your
            hosting account.
		
	g.  You're done! Congratulations, you'll now be able to post you first
	    article. Enjoy. You may customize the look of the blog system by
	    editing the /includes/style.css file with a text editor. A bit of CSS
            syntax knowledge would be useful for that. Feel free though to change
            colors, font sizes, etc.
		
	    You may also change the images as you want. The image files are in
	    the /images/ subdirectory.
		


 * 6 // ADDITIONAL NOTES //********************************************************/
 
    This e-moBLOG version is version 1.3

    Version 1.1 was a pre-release version that was not meant to be public and was
    used for tests only.
	


 * 7 // RELEASE & VERSION NOTES //*************************************************/

    a.  Resolved issues - version 1.3

        - fixed a bug with the server time offset.
        - fixed a bug concerning the admin panel login system. The whole login
          system has been rebuild using another approach. It now should be working
          fine for most people.
        - the [url=...][/url] and [img][/img] tags can now be overlapped without
          any problem occuring, such as a posted image can now be a link as well.
        - comments to be sent by mail were not sent correctly if the "single author"
          option was enabled. This is fixed.

    b.  known bugs - version 1.3
	
        - an image attached to a message sent for posting though the mobile
          blogging feature could be discarded or unproperly displayed, depending on
          your device/mobile phone operator/software. Please read instructions in
          this file for more informations.

    c.  new features - version 1.3

        - a RSS feed (fully RSS 2.0 compatible).
        - comments may now be moderated by the owner(s).
        - added a comment in the db.php file to explain how to change the file
          if your MySQL server requires a special port to be used.
        - the blog now displays either the X last posts (and NOT the X last posts
          *of the current month* anymore), or all posts from the current month.
        - a search engine has been added.
        - moblogging (mobile blogging) capability added.
        - automatic image resize is now an option that can be enabled or not.
        - it is now possible to align an image to the right or to the left of your
          text. This is done by using the [img left] or [img right] opening tags
          instead of the simple [img] opening tag. The closing tag is always [/img]
          though.
        - image gallery feature has been added. It automatically records every image
          you include in your articles, deletes the images related to an article if
          you delete this article, and you are also able to add (or edit) an image
          directly in the gallery without posting any article. Images automatically
          added while adding an article can only be deleted by deleting the
          referring article.
        - added a visitor counter, which displays the total number of visitors
          currently reading your website.

    d.  version history of resolved issues - version 1.2

        - fixed a bug that caused the archives to be limited to the same number
          of displayed posts than the main page.
          (thanks to Gerhard Lazu - http://blog.gerhardlazu.com)
        - fixed a layout bug that caused the blog pages to display incorrectly
          when changing the table cells background color into the CSS file.
        - fixed a small bug in the archives page hyperlinks.
        - fixed the comments form width such as it displays correctly with Opera
          browser, even when the blog maximum width is set to the minimum.
        - fixed another small layout problem in the admin section.
        - fixed the "top" internal link which now works with Opera and Mozilla
          internet browsers.
