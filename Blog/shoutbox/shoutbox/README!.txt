    - You need to run this SQL query to the right database using phpMyAdmin or other SQL GUI you're using.
3. Upload the folder "shoutbox" in your MAIN site directory.
4. - Go to your www.yoursite.com/shoutbox/shoutbox.php to see the shoutbox
    - To include the shoutbox to your main site use this PHP code:

         <?php include("shoutbox/shoutbox.php"); ?> 
    
    Use the code above wherever you want to put your shoutbox.
5. You can edit the shoutbox looks by modifying the CSS internal style.
