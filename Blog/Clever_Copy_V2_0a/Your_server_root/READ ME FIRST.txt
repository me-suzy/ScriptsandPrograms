Installing Clever Copy is straightforward and is performed by the inbuilt installer.
--------------------------------------

First, upload all the files and folders to your webserver root. Make sure that you retain the
directory structure as shown below. You may install Clever Copy in any directory of your
server. 


Server root ----     <-------- This is the top level (e.g. http://www.yoursite.com)
                |
                .htaccess
                about.php
                acronymblock.php
                acronyms.php
                activateppc.php
                addtoweblinks.php
                adminblock.php
                |
                + other files
                |
                weblinksblock.php
                welcome.php
                whoonlineblock.php
                |
                |_ admin
                |       |_ items
                |       |_ languages
                |
		|_ banners
                |_ downloads
                |_ gallery
                |        |_ photos
                |                |_ buttons
                |                |_ thumb
                |_ images
                |        |_ admin
                |
                |_ install
                |        |_ languages
                |
                |_ languages
                |_ news
                |_ newsletter
                |_ personalities
                |_ poll
                |_ randompics
                |_ randomquotes
                |_ stats
                |_ tag
                     |_ smilies



---------------------------------------

You then need to change the permissions (Chmod) of the following directories:

admin - change to 777 (write all, read all, execute all)
admin/items - change to 777 (write all, read all, execute all)
gallery - change to 777 (write all, read all, execute all)
gallery/photos - change to 777 (write all, read all, execute all)
gallery/photos/thumb - change to 777 (write all, read all, execute all)
news - change to 777 (write all, read all, execute all)
stats - change to 777 (write all, read all, execute all)

For instructions on how to chmod, run the installer (see below)
---------------------------------------



Once you have uploaded all the files and folders and changed the permissions, browse to
http://www.yoursite.com/install or http://www.yoursite.com.

The installer will run and prompt you for the necessay information. If you don't know how to
chmod directories, the installer will provide a link to a help file.
If you receive any error messages during the install process, deal with them in top down order
i.e. resolve the problem that appears at the top of the list before moving on to resolve the
next problem. Most problems are associated with each other and curing the first problem found
usually resolves the problems that follow.

Once your install has been successfull, you will be prompted to go to your site main page and you will
then need to login. Once logged in with the info you provided during the install, you will be able to 
access your admin panel.


Should the installer fail for some reason, you can get help from the Clever Copy support
