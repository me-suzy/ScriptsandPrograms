You will probably want to set this default banner to either your own site or another site you own. You can set the default banner to expire after a single click if you wish and it will still be shown in place of expired client banners, this will effectively prevent the default banner taking views that could be used for client banners.

Banners can be either gif or jpg files and recommended sizes are 470x60 for top banners and side banners must not exceed 150 in width.
