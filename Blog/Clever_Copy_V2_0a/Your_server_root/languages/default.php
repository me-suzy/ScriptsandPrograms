Pay Per Click (or ppc) is a method of advertising your site that allows you to set your advertising budget beforehand. This method of advertising is extremely
effective meaning that you only pay for the actual traffic that is sent to your site unlike banner adverts where you pay to show a banner regardless of
whether anyone clicks that banner or not.<br><br>

With ppc you define both the invoicing period and the maximum amount you want to pay for your clicks over that invoicing period. This puts you in firm control
of how your advertising is managed.<br><br>

Here's an example of how it works: This site has a set rate for each click that a visitor might make on your link,
currently that set rate is just";

$25.00, your link would be displayed continually until either the 30 days has expired or your maximum budget is reached. It doesn't matter if your link is
displayed  100,000 times or just 100 times because you only pay if a visitor clicks your link. If your budget is reached, let's say on day 20 of your 30 day invoicing period, your
link is then temporarily suspended until the next invoicing period of 30 days begins in 10 days time. In this way you will never exceed your allocated monthly
budget and you know exactly how much you will pay for that month's advertising. If your link generates no traffic, no invoice is sent and your link is
automatically renewed to run for the next invoicing period.

<br><br>At any time you can log in to your own personalised ppc account area and check on the progress of your link, see your current spend, pause
or resume your campaign or cancel it. If you want to take up our ppc advertising option on this site, please fill out the form below and we will set up an account
for you and begin your campaign. You can cancel at any time by simply clicking 'cancel link' in your ppc account area.";
