 * IMPORANT NOTE *

The CaLogic folder structure and placement of some of the CaLogic
files has changed as of CaLogic 1.2.2

When updating from 1.2.1 or earlier to 1.2.2 or higher, please
move the file "dbloader.php" from your CaLogic include folder to your
CaLogic admin folder before running the update.


CaLogic Update Instructions
===========================

Please read all documentation in the docs folder.

For first time installations, please read the installing.txt file.

For quick first time installation instructions read quick-install.txt

ALWAYS START THE SETUP OR UPDATE IN A FRESH BROWSER!
WHICH MEANS YOU SHOULD CLOSE ALL BROWSERS, OPEN A NEW ONE,
THEN NAVIGATE TO THE SETUP OR UPDATE FILE.

MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR CURRENT CALOGIC DIRECTORY AND
YOUR CALOGIC DATABASE JUST IN CASE!

The CaLogic update program will update any previous version of CaLogic.


Update procedure
================

1. Remove all contents from your current CaLogic folder EXCEPT THE ADMIN FOLDER!
   NOTE: Be careful not to delete any of your own files (images for example), that
   you may have added to the CaLogic folder.

2. Upload all contents from the new CaLogic folder to your CaLogic folder.

Enter the URL to update.php in your browser.

For example:
    http://www.yourweb.com/calogic/setup/update.php

First the database will be updated if needed, then the configuration form
will appear. Check / set the options for your needs, then click submit at the
bottom of the form.


    REMOVE THE CALOGIC SETUP FOLDER FROM YOUR WEB!!!


To reconfigure CaLogic later, do not use the update.php file. Use the
"CaLogic Configure" link under the Admin heading of the functions menu.


That's it.

Read all the files in the docs folder.
