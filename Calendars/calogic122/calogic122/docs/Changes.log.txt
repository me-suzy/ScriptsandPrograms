Changes and further developments to CaLogic
===========================================

Please read all documentation in the docs folder.


Version 1.2.2
=================
Started: 20 July 2004, Finished: 13 Nov 2004

 * IMPORANT NOTE *

The CaLogic folder structure and placement of some of the CaLogic
files has changed as of CaLogic 1.2.2

When updating from 1.2.1 or earlier to 1.2.2 or higher, please
move the file "dbloader.php" from your CaLogic include folder to your
CaLogic admin folder before running the update.

Always read the updating.txt file when updating.


Changes:

The mini cal plugin has been updated. Anyone using this feature should
see the mcpi-demo.php file for the changes. There is a new "block" that
has to be added to your html documents that include the mini cal plugin.

There is a new field in the _setup table called calogic_uid.
This filed is generated one time upon installation or during
an update if it has not yet been generated. It contains a
unique value called a GUID. This value can and must be used
for automating Admin functions. The calogic_uid is very important.
You should take great care not to expose the calogic_uid. Do not
use it in links. It is meant only to be used in php programs.

CaLogic now has an Automation API.

Functions that are automated:
    Creating and deleting a user
    Creating and deleting a calendar
    Automatically logging a user on
    Emulating a user

Emulating a user is already built in:
Admins can now "Emulate" or logon as other users without needing a password. To do this,
logon as admin, go to the user settings, select the user you want to emulate, then click
"Emulate User". Doing this will log the admin user off and log you on as the selected
user. This function is intended to help you support your users.

For instructions on how to automate CaLogic using the Automation API, read
the automating_calogic.txt file in the docs folder.

The CaLogic session handling has been somewhat modified.
CaLogic now sets a cookie that stores the session ID. This
takes care of a few problems that I have experienced over the
years. For example, the PHP setting use_trans_sid is now
irrelevant. Also, because of the cookie, the PHP Session ID
no longer has to be transmitted with links when use_trans_sid
is turned off. The bad part about this is, the user must
accept a cookie or the session will not be propagated from
page to page. CaLogic includes a P3P header stipulating
that no Personal Information is stored, and that the cookie
is only for session state.

CaLogic no longer requires the PHP setting of register_globals to be on.

Language tables have been updated a little.
Also, Language Table entries now get added dynamically,
so if you have done some adding your self, there should
be no conflicts with the uid field. Meaning any future
changes I make will not (should not) conflict with changes
you may have made, or may make.

Each user can now set thier own time zone offset in the user settings area.
And there is a new "time zone lock" feature, when activated, it ensures that
the time zone offset you enter does not get changed when logging on. This is
to correct the problems that some have reported, when being on hosted
systems that do not have the correct time zone set. (and thier provider was
unwilling to do anything about it).

Added the per calendar option to allow the showing of events in
"Out of Month cell blocks" in the month view and mini cal.
Those are the cell blocks in the month and mini calendar, that
belong to the previous and next month. In the standard setup,
they are white in color, and usualy only display the day number.
Well, if you enable this option, these cells will also display
any events for those days. To turn this on, a user must turn on
the option "Display Out of Month Day Numbers".
This was a user requested modification.

*Finally* added all of the "per calendar" configuration options that
were only available in the Admin config area, to the Calendar Config
area. This means, that if the site admin allows it, a calendar owner now
has more calendar configuration options. For example, the header
and footer banner settings can now be set on a per calendar basis.
Basically all the options in the admin config area, that are under the
headings of: "Site Look and Feel" and "Calendar Look and Feel" can
now also be set on a per calendar basis. And if you look close enuf
at previous versions, it is even stated there next to the heading in
the admin config area, that "these are the default values, and that they
can be changed in the calendar config area" by the calendar owners. But
that wasn't true up til now. Also, I've added options to those areas in the
admin config, that gives you, the admin, the option of turning these
options on or off for the calendar owners. Also, because these
are new options that the users have never had, they are turned off
by default. So if you want to allow your calendar owners to be able to
change any of the settings for thier own calendars, you will have to enable
the options that allow them to make the changes.
Note that admin users will always be able see the per calendar
settings in the calendar config area. I also know, that perhaps
a lot of normal users may be overwhelmed by the many new configuration
options. so, you as site admin may choose to just keep the settings
turned off.

The Standard Default Calendar Option has been moved from the Calendar Config
Area to the CaLogic Admin Config Area. This is where it belongs anyway.

The Email format for reminders can now be set individually for users, contacts,
and event subscribers. There are 3 types of email format: plain text, HTML and
SMS. SMS is a short plain text format that will not excede 150 characters. It is
used for sending mail to PDAs or cell phones (handy) or other devices that may
have a charcter limit. The Email Format Setting field in the CaLogic Config Area
was used to set all current users, contacts and subscribers. Now, it's only use
is for the site owner notification mails that get sent out. All other System mail
settings are still used, like the "User Name in Email" setting for example.
In order for anonymous subscribers to be able to make use of the SMS option
a site admin must enable the new "Allow Anonymous Subscriber SMS" option in
the CaLogic config area. Thanks to Gerry for helping me figure out how to get
this option rolling.
This was (partially) a user requested modification.

The Calendar Title and user name has been removed from the upper part of the header.
This is because it is now an option to have the title shown.

Admins can now see/configure/delete calendars of other users. However
the user events on a private calendar will not be seen by the editing admin.
This was a user requested modification.

Added the admin option to turn off the functions menu for non admin users.

Added the admin option for the text used to name the functions menu.
This was a user requested modification.

Rearranged the Admin Config Area a little, so that the "site" options are
separated from the "per calendar default" options.

Added font and color configuration options for the popups. User customisation
of these options can also be turned on or off.

The Week, Month and Year view "Pull down" menus as well as the calendar pull
down menu have all been replaced with a new menu. This new "Horizontal Bar Menu"
is designed to save space and look nice. The colors and fonts of this menu are configurable
in the CaLogic Admin Config Area, and if allowed, in the individual calendar configurations.
The Side Bar "Sliding Functions Menu" can now either be placed in the new
Horizontal Menu Bar, or be left on the side or both.
This was (partly) a user requested modification.

The Popup and Menu color configurations for the individual calendars has made up
a new area in the CaLendar Config Area.

Added options to control the displaying of the mini calendar in each view.
The options are: Left, Right, Both or none. If left or right is selected then
the current month will be displayed. If both is chosen then the previous and
next months will be displayed. Guess what happens if you chose none? ;-)
These options are also user customisable in the View Areas of the Calendar Config Area.
This was a user requested modification.

A calendar owner can now specify, if conflicting events can be saved or not.
This was a user requested modification.

The contacts list is now sorted by last name, first name. The list of
reminder contacts is also now sorted in the event view.

The word "<script" will now be replaced with "< \ script"
in all areas that allow for user input. This is to stop hacking.
Because CaLogic allows for HTML in the description, it was possible to enter
a bogus description that could cause anything from endless popups to relocating.
I did this because a Guestbook of mine was hacked in this manner. I tested to
see if I could do the same thing with CaLogic and I could. So I modified it to the
extent I think will effectively prevent such misuse.

There is now a "Check for Updates" link on the CaLogic Config form" Click it to check
if there are updates available. The check will open in its own window.

Fixed a bug in the week view that caused a clicked event to show the wrong date.
Thanks to Kate for the report *and* the fix!

Fixed a probelm that, when the week view is defined as the starting view,
it was not showing the correct dates, and the Week Pull Down dates
were all wrong upon startup. Thanks to all who reported this bug.

Fixed a bug that appeared only when the Default Calendar Option was turned
on, and then the Public View Option was turned on. Thanks to Mitch for his
help in getting this error fixed.

fixed a security leak that allowed any user (even the guest user) to delete
any event on any calendar. I also found this same kind of "bug" in other
areas and killed it as well.

Fixed some bugs I found on the contacts form. Also, selecting Association mode no
longer clears the selected contacts/groups.

Fixed a bug that caused some repeating events to be shown on the wrong day


Version 1.2.1
=================
29 May 2004

The changes made in this version are mostly user requests.
Some long awaited, some new.

As I stated in the previous version, I will be releasing
CaLogic after each few changes instead of trying to do alot
of changes in each release.

As usual, make sure you backup your CaLogic database and
folder structure before updating.

Changes:

Fixed a few minor bugs.

Calendar pulldown menu is now sorted alphabetically.

Changed the demo mode to not allow for changing of the
Calendar name, title or type.

Added the per calendar option to have event conflict checking
be restricted to events that are in the same categorie.

Reminder info now does not show when reminders are turned off.

Added the per calendar option to allow for displaying of the
calendar title in the view header.

Added the per calendar option that allows you to control exactly
which Event Information gets displayed. Calendar owners and admins
will always be able to see all event info on thier own calendars.

The Guest user (available only when "Public View" is on) can now post
events to open calendars. If you do not like this setting, then you
have to change your open calendars to public ones.

IMPORTANT: Don't forget. Befor updating or installing for the first
time, it is important that you close all of your open browsers, then
open a new browser and navigate to one of the files: update.php
(for updating) or setup.php (for first time installing).





Version 1.2.0
=================
12 April 2004

NOTE!!!
This is quite an extensive update. I highly urge you to make a backup
of your CaLogic Database and program files before updating. If something
goes wrong with the update, you will need to restore the database and
program files.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

As usual, I have tested CaLogic to the best of my ability. But because this
is such an enormous update, I expect there will be some bugs....
Now it's up to you to find and report them.

Fixed problems with the mini calendar plug in. I had made so many changes to
other parts of CaLogic, I forgot to update the mini cal. It is working now.
Please read the mcpi-demo.php file. This file is an example of how to
integrate a mini calendar into any php page. There are also new
variables that must be set in the file.

Fixed a bug that caused problems with events when more than 9 contacts
or groups were in the database.

fixed a bug that allowed events to be submitted, even when the check
conditions had not been met.

fixed a bug with the Event Collision Check. Thanks to Justice for submitting
this bug report.

fixed a bug in the user editor.

fixed the problem with week numbers not being consistant. also fixed the
week select box itself, it wasn't working properly.

fixed the language selection problem for public view. Now a "Guest" viewer
can select any language, and it won't conflict with other "Guest" users.

fixed a problem with the back ground color not be displayed.

the font and font color can now be set for each calendar individually. If it is
not set, then the global font and color will be used.

Added the Swedish language, many thanks to Christian Sahlé for the translation.

For security purposes, now only the event creator and admins can see the
email address of subscribers.

Optimized the Email Syntax checker.

Extended the demo mode to allow view of all options.

Added "multiple groups per contact". Now, a contact can belong to more than
one group. Also, contacts ang groups can now be shared with other users.

Added a "Forgot my Password" button to the logon screen. To request a new
password, a user must enter thier e-mail address. If the address is found
in the user table, an e-mail will be sent to them with a confirmation link.
Once the user clicks on the confirmation link, a new random password will
be generated and sent to them via e-mail. To prevent cracking, no error
message gets displayed if the requested e-mail does not exist in the user
table. As a matter of fact, it will look like request was succsessful.

Added "Remember my user name and password" check box to the logon screen.
Now it is possible to have your user name and pasword stored in a cookie
for one year.

User registration is also now an option. Admins can opt to not allow
for user registration.

Admins may now manually create users. Manually created users do not
have to confirm thier registration.

Added Extended Event Fields. This was a very difficult thing to do, and
it's one of the reasons this release took so long. And it was worth it!

Extended Event Fields are a way to allow you to define fields that can
be filled out when creating/editing an event. They are dynamic fields.
There is no limit to the number of fields you can define. There is also
no limit to the number of fields an event can have. You can define the
fields either when creating/editing an event, or in the Extended Event
Field Manager. You can define three types of fields. Input (a single line),
Textarea (multiple line), and Select fields. In select fields, you also
must supply the options. Fields can be defined as "required", meaning it
must be filled, or it can be standard, meaning it will automatically be
displayed but don't have to be filled in. Also, input fields
can be set for validation. Meaning that if it is filled, it must meet
certain requirements. there are 3 types of validation available;
Date, Number and Text. Also, Input fields have a max length option.
Any non required fields can be removed from an event. Also, non
required fields are automatically removed if empty.
As Admin, you can opt to allow users to create / add extended
fields in the CaLogic Config area.

Added Event Reminder Subscriptions. This feature allows anyone to
subscribe for an event reminder. It is also used for adding Registered
users to the reminder list. For this to work, reminders must be
turned on by an admin. And the event creator must then allow for
event reminder subscriptions by activating the check box when creating
or editing the event. If a person subscribes themself for a reminder,
they must confirm the subscription thru an automated email, much like
that when registering (double opt in). If a series event is subscribed for,
then an "unsubscribe" link is included in the reminder mail.

Event reminders are also now flexible. Meaning each contact can have
a different reminder interval set. This is also true for Event Reminder
Subscribers.

Using the Event Subscriptions function, it is now quite easy to create
multiple reminders for the same event. Just keep creating reminder
subscriptions for yourself.

Added User Password History. Now, an admin can define the amount of time
a password is valid, after that, a user must change their password before
logging on. There are no grace logons allowed. An admin can also define the
min length of passwords, as well as the use interval. Admins can now set
other users passwords. Or designate that the user must change their password
upon next login.

Added the ability to make "Exceptions" to series events.
Exceptions will allow you to exclude individual occurances of series events.
Each exception can be "re-instated".

Added a "history log". Now, (almost) all actions are recorded in the history log
table. The history log can only be viewed by admins. In a later version,
calendar owners will also be able to view the log, if the admin allows it.

A user can now copy or move events between it's calendars or to other
open/public calendars. An admin can copy/move an event to any calendar.
Event collisions are not checked during a copy/move, but the collision
will naturally display in a view. Copying an event creates a new event
on the calendar to which it is copied. The copied to event is not in any
way connected to the copied from event. Event reminders as well as Extended
Fields will be copied if restrictions permit. For example, if you
create an extended field for use only by you, on your own calendars, and then
copy an event that uses this extent to a calendar not owned by you, then the
extent won't (obviously can't) be copied. Also, Exceptions are not copied or moved.

The "Event Status Column" can now be turned on or off on a per calendar
basis.

Added a "Database Maintenance" section for admins. it is now possible
to backup and restore your CaLogic database right from within CaLogic.

Enhanced the Event Description Popup. Also, when holding the mouse over a day
on the mini cal which has an event will display a popup with the event information.



Whew! Time for a vacation!



Version 1.1.9
=================
31 July 2003

Updated the "reminders.txt" file. This is the documentation on how to setup
reminders, as well as other files in the docs folder.

Added the French language to the database. Merci to Antoine Hurtado for
translating. But remember, there is still a lot of hard coded english in
the program. I hope to get it all in the language tables soon.

Fixed an error in the reminders script, that caused the wrong contact name to
appear in the email, if more than one user/contact was on the reminders list.

Event collisons are now reported when adding an event. If an event collison
is detected, you will be given a list of events that collide with the new event.
You will then be given the choice of saving the event as is, editing the event or
deleting it.
Because CaLogic has the option of creating an event series that never ends, event
collisons will only be detected as far into the future as you set the "Reminder
Days in Advance" setting for. So, if you set reminders to be checked up to lets
say 365 days into the future, then event collison checks will only reach 365 days
from the first day of the new event. The Collision check also only allows a max
of 400 days.

Collision Checking can be turned on or off on a per calendar basis. Do this on
the Calendar Config page. Also, you can choose to include "All Day Events" in
the collision checking or not.

Enhanced the Event status column. The Event Status Columnm, is the small space
on the left of every event. In earlier versions, only an "R" would be shown
for events with Reminders. Now, 3 more Status marks get shown. An "A" for all day
events, an "S" for series or repeating events, and a "C" for events that collide
with other events.

Finally added the long awaited "Standard Font Option". It is now possible to change
the font to be used in displaying the different calendar views. It can only be changed
in the Admin Configuration area.


Version 1.1.8
=================
26 July 2003

Another patch.


I (or rather CaLogic users) have run into an interesting problem. It seems
that if you Have Apache 2.x and PHP 4.2.2 installed, then mixed HTML
and PHP on one line doesn't always work. If you have this combination,
or if you are experiencing things like; clicking on the new event
button just brings you back to the calendar view, or the setup isn't
completing, then you have this problem. Well, it has been fixed with
this version. At least all the problems that have been reported to me
have been fixed :-)



Version 1.1.7
=================
24 July 2003


Another patch.

Fixed a wierd bug that caused the blank page to appear after submitting
the Database settings form. I thought it was fixed in 1.1.6, but it was
obviously not. Thanks to Eric for letting me use his server to get this
bug killed.



Version 1.1.6
=================
23 July 2003

This is basicly a patch, but I always release all files.

Added the footer link and "alt" text for header and footer links.
I really did this time, scouts honor!

Fixed the problem with the setup / update that caused a blank
page to show after the datadase setup. It seems a few of the
files did not have the proper line endings.
Thanks to Support Site User Iom for finding this error.




Version 1.1.5
=================
18 July 2003

I have made some significant code changes in this version. almost every file
has been modified. Most of the changes, have to do with the handling of
the different magic_quotes settings. So if you notice any stray backslash
characters (\) please let me know.

I have also implemented a PHP function, that I hope will take care of any
problems regarding REGISTER_GLOBALS. If it works, it should no longer
matter if the setting is turned off or on.

Fixed an error in the reminder script that caused the reminder mail
to be corrupted.

Fixed a few problems with the setup / update routines.

Added a routine that checks email addys for invalid characters.

Added a German Language file. However, it is somewhat incomplete. Also, there is
still lots of hard coded english. There is also a problem with selecting
a language other than the default.

Updated the documentation, so please....
read all the files in the docs folder.



Version 1.1.4
=================
14 July 2003

This is just a small fix, but an important one.

Fixed errors in the setup / update routines.



Version 1.1.3
=================
22 February 2003

Fixed all bugs reported to me.

Sorry, I had forgotten to finish the footer link function in the previous
version. But hey! Now you can also add the "alternate text" for the
header and footer images! Thats the text that shows up when you place
the mouse over an image, and in case the image don't show up for some
reason, then the "alternate text" is displayed in its place.

Added a new option to the calendar config page. Now you can choose how
you want the weeks to be numbered. Either the ISO way, which states:
Weeks range from 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week that has at
least 4 days in the current year, and with Monday as the first day of the week
Or the other way which states: The first week in January with a Monday is week 1.
Although the ISO method states, that you must also have your weeks starting
on Monday, CaLogic does not enforce this rule. Meaning you could set to use
the ISO method, and still have your weeks start with sunday. But then the
week numbers probably won't match any paper calendars you have.

Finally added the long missed and awaited "Forgot Password" routine. It is
of course only available from the logon screen. The procedure will mail
the user a new password that must be confirmed. Only after the confirmation
will the original password be changed.



Version 1.1.2
=================
20 February 2003

Fixed all bugs reported to me.

The header and footer links are now working.

Greatly enhanced the setup and update routines. The
setup will no longer run if CaLogic is already installed.
To re-run the setup, you must remove or rename the settings.php
file and the dbloader.php file.
The update routine will now update your installation of
CaLogic no matter what version you are updating from. Also,
running the update repeatedly will have no inadvertent
effects.

Have added the reminder configuration variables to the
setup table. So now, there is REALLY no more need to
edit or set anything in any text files. You will however
need to set the variables on the configuration form to
the same values you had set in the remcfg.php file.

Modified the send reminder script to also support SMTP.

Corrected some errors in the Standard Default Calendar option.

It no longer matters how PHP's magic_quotes variables are set,
either on or off will work.

Added more information to the readme file.



Version 1.1.1
=================
14 February 2003

This is mostly a fix up version. But it does have some
additions as well.

Added an additionl field to the events form called
"Sub Title". The text descriptor for this field is freely
definable from the CaLogic Configuration form.
For example, you could define it as "Location:" if you wanted.
The field and it's descriptor only get displayed in views and
mails, if something is entered in the field when adding/editing
the event.

Clicking on an event in the month or week view with the CTRL key
held down, will open the event in a popup view window.

Fixed some code that could have caused major data integrity
problems.

I had to make some changes / additions to make usage of the
Standard Default Calendar option more reliable.

Made some methodic changes as to how the management of
users / calendars is handled.

All documents are now located in the docs folder. Most of
the documents have been updated, you should read them all.

Fixed a few errors that I found along the way.



Version 1.1.0
=================
09 February 2003


CaLogic is no longer an Alpha Version. After a year
of Alpha releases, I think we can consider it a well
tested (and used) application.

So, what's new in this version? Actually quite a bit.

All the bugs found and reported have been fixed.

The setup and update routines have been fine tuned.

The email sending systm has beed redone, and SMTP
mail is now supported.

Admin email is finished. This option will allow the admin
to receive an email under certain circumstances. For
example when a user registers, or when a new event is
created.

Categories can now be defined as "Global", meaning that
all users can use them. But only the creator of the
category can delete or change it.

An example of the category is also now displayed when
adding / editing an event.

Event creator name display can now be turned off.

There is a new option called "Standard Default Calendar".
When turned on, all new users are assigned the calendar
you select. This feature should be used if you only want
to have one calendar shared by all users. Therefore, the
calendar you select as the standard default must be of
open or public type.
To activate this feature, go to the Calendar
Configuration screen and turn on the option.
This option also sets various other options.
User customisation is turned off.
The Calendar Quick Navigation is turned off.
These options could still be turned back on. But it
isn't advised. If you turn the "Standard Default Calendar"
option off again, then you must turn the other options back
on yourself if you wish.

The View Navigation pull down menus can now be turned off or on.
This is a prelude to the ability to turn each view off and on,
which is not yet finishd.

Fixed a problem with the functions menu that caused it to
do the jitter bug.

Well, that's about it for this version. See you in the next one!



Version 1.0.5a.P1
=================
24 January 2003


This is a Bug fix release. To implement the fix, just upload
all files to your CaLogic folder, overwritting the files
already there.

Fixed the bug that displayed the wrong day names of repeating
events when using Sunday as the first day of the week setting



Version 1.0.5a
==============
18 January 2003

First of all, my apologies that this version took so long to get out.
Second, if you had requested a feature that is not yet in this
version, sorry again. I will get to it as soon as I can.

What's new? Probably not as much as you had hoped, but still...

The Install process is now fully automated. No more editing of
any text files EXCEPT for the reminders config file (remcfg.php).
The three variables in this file must still be set by hand.
The main reason for this is, there is a lot to read in that file.
It is more of a tutorial that a config file. So if you want reminders
on a unix/linux system, read that file, as well as readme_reminders.txt.

The Admin user is now automatically created durring the setup process unless
you are updating, in which case it is assumed that admin has already been created.

Overlapping events are highlighted with box frames in the day and week views.

The "Functions" pull down is now a "floating" menu. It is visible in the
upper left corner. Just place your mouse over it, and it will slide open.

Administrators have access to the Site Configuration link located on the
functions menu.

Lots of new Site configuration settings.

The Calendar configuration can be disabled for normal users.

Users can now choose from a list of calendars in the header of each view.

PHP Error reporting is now controlled in the script, so no more stupid
warnings and or notices.

Events can now be "Shared" on public and open calendars. I.e. if you or
anyone creates an event on an open or public calendar, all other users
will also be able to see the event. But only the creator of the event or
administrators can edit or delete the event. In addition, user names are
displayed above the events created by other users.

The "Public view calendar" is finished. If you choose to use this feature,
a special user and calendar will be created (User "Guest" calendar "Public").
Then, any time someone surfs to the calendar, the "Guest" user will automatically
be logged on and the  "Public view calendar" will be displayed.
This "Guest" user cannot add/change/delete events, or change the look of the
calendar, unless demo mode is on.


Thats about it for this version.

Read the "readme.txt" for instructions on installing / updating.



Version 1.0.4a.P2
==============
9.07.2002

All files of previous version patches are also
included in this patch

Fixed an error with the minical and year views.
If a category was defined without a background
color, the day with event cell would show up
totally black. Such a day will now default to
the standard color of days with events.



Version 1.0.4a.P1
==============
06.07.2002

This is a patch to version 1.0.4a

Fixed an error in the reminders script that was reporting
only the start date of a repeating event in Reminder Mails.

Fixed a problem with the 12 Hour option. It just wasn't
working properly.

Backgroung colors of days with events in the mini calendar
and the year view, will now show the color of the category
of the first event of that day. If no category is specifyed, then
the default color will be used.

A new option in the config.php will allow you to turn off the
"Event Scroll Box". The variable name is $withesb, if set
to false, then the scroll box will not be used.

Antoher new option in the config.php will tell CaLogic
wether or not to use names in the To and From fields of

instead of january.
