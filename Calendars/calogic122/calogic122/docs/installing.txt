Get the latest version at http://www.calogic.de/


REQUIREMENTS
=============

A web server with PHP 4.3.2 or higher installed
A MySQL 3.23.47 or higher Database

PHP Options needed:

    Session support on
    MySQL support on
    Safe Mode off


CaLogic WILL MOST LIKELY NOT work with PHP and/or MySQL versions lower than those listed.


A Javascript enabled Browser (I have tested it with IE Explorer 5.5 and 6.0)
* NOTE *. CaLogic will most likely not work with any browser except
Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 and above.

If you are unsure if your installation of PHP is configured with
the above required options use PHPINFO to find out. How do you
use PHPINFO you ask?

Create a file, name it phpinfo.php and type only the following
three lines in it:

<?php
phpinfo()
?>

save the file, upload it to your web, and enter the URL in your
browser http://www.myweb/phpinfo.php for example You will get a nice
page of information about the PHP installation on your server.
If you don't get the list, you either don't have PHP on your server,
or you didn't type the above three lines as-is, OR the php installation
on your server has this function disabled (which is VERY uncommon)



FIRST TIME INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

ALWAYS START THE SETUP OR UPDATE IN A FRESH BROWSER!
WHICH MEANS YOU SHOULD CLOSE ALL BROWSERS, OPEN A NEW ONE,
THEN NAVIGATE TO THE SETUP OR UPDATE FILE.


For instructions on updating a previous installation,
read the updating.txt file.

If you plan on using reminders, then you should read the reminders.txt file
for information on setting up reminders.


STEP 1:
    Unpack the distributed zip file to your local computer.
    Since you are reading this, I assume you have unpacked the distributed
    zip file already. Just make sure you unpack the zip preserving the directory
    structure.

STEP 2:
    Upload the CaLogic directory structure to your web.

    Make the CaLogic admin folder writable (CHMOD 777).

    * NOTE *
    After the installation, read only rights are recommended for the entire
    CaLogic folder structure!

STEP 3:
   Point your browser to setup.php, located in the CaLogic setup folder.
   For example:
   http://www.yourdomain.com/calogic/setup/setup.php

   The first page is the database setup.
   Fill out the form and click submit.

   * NOTE *
   If you are on a hosted web server, be sure to answer NO to the
   Create Database question. Only answer YES to this question if you
   are the administrator of the MySQL server, and you know what you
   are doing.


   At this stage the MySQL tables and database access files are created.

   The second page is the application config page.

   Select all desired options and click submit. (These options can easily be changed
   at a later time.)

   After a second or two, "Setup finished" will appear with a link to start CaLogic.


    The Setup is now finished.

    REMOVE THE CALOGIC SETUP FOLDER FROM YOUR WEB!!!



Notes on the installation:

   The admin user is automatically created by the setup. User: admin, password: admin

   The first time any user logs on, he/she will have to create a calendar, unless
   the "Standard Default Calendar" option is turned on.

   The Admin user must also create a calendar upon first logon.

   Go to "User Settings" from the functions menu to change the password and to fill out
   the rest of your user information.

   DO NOT re-run the setup.php program unless you are having problems.

   To reconfigure the options, use the "CaLogic Config" link from the
   Admin Section of the functions menu.
   You must be logged on as admin to access this area.

    If you plan on using reminders, then you should read the reminders.txt file
    for information on setting up reminders.


Read all the files in the docs folder.


That's basically it! You should be able to start CaLogic now.
