CaLogic Quick Installation instructions
===============================================

CaLogic will install or update in a matter of seconds.

It is the easiest PHP program to install or
update that I have ever seen. I am very proud of this.

CaLogic will update itself from any previous version.

Since you are reading this, you must have already
unpacked the zip file. Just make sure that you
unpacked it preserving the folder structure.

IMPORTANT!!

AFTER AN INSTALLATION OR UPDATE, REMOVE THE CALOGIC SETUP
FOLDER FROM YOUR WEB.

For updating read the "updating.txt" file.


Quick Install Instructions:
==========================

* NOTE *
If you intend to use reminders, you must read the reminders.txt file
located in the CaLogic docs folder.


1. upload the folder structure to your web.

2. Make the CaLogic folder "admin" writable (CHMOD 777).

    * NOTE *
    After the installation, read only rights are recommended for the entire
    CaLogic folder structure!


3. open a browser and navigate to the setup.php file
i.e. http://www.yourweb.com/calogic/setup/setup.php

4. Enter your MySQL server, database name, user name and password.

* NOTE *
Only answer YES to the create database question if you
are the MySQL Server admin.

click Submit

Select the CaLogic options. As a minimum you should fill
in your name and email address. All the other default options
are okay for a quick install.

Click the Submit button located at the bottom of the form.


Thats it! You will be presented with a link to start CaLogic.

I reccomend  to make the entire CaLogic folder read only.

IMPORTANT!!

REMOVE THE SETUP FOLDER FROM YOUR WEB!


* NOTE *

   The admin user is automatically created by the setup. User: admin, password: admin

   The first time any user logs on, he/she will have to create a calendar, unless
   the "Standard Default Calendar" option is turned on.

   The Admin user must also create a calendar upon first logon.

   Go to "User Settings" from the functions menu to change the password and to fill out
   the rest of your user information.

   DO NOT re-run the setup.php program unless you are having problems.

   To reconfigure the options, use the "CaLogic Config" link from the
   Admin Section of the functions menu.
   You must be logged on as admin to access this area.

    If you plan on using reminders, then you should read the reminders.txt file
    for information on setting up reminders.


Read all the files in the docs folder.
