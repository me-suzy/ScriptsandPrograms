CaLogic Reminders, A HOW TO GUIDE
=================================

Please read all documentation in the docs folder.


The program that checks for, and sends reminders is srxclr.php, and is 
located in the root directory of CaLogic. 

Each reminder will only be sent one time. In the case of repeating
events, a reminder will be sent one time for each occurance of the event.

So if I have an event that occurs every Monday at 12:00, and have the 
reminder for the event setup to be sent 15 minutes prior to 
the event, then I would recieve a reminder every Monday at 11:45.

The reminder script will catch and send a reminder up to 2 days
after the event takes place, if the reminder had not been sent
for some reason.

You can rename srxclr.php but do not relocate it. 

The file must be accessable to a browser, unless you can 
call the PHP interpreter to parse the file.

You must set the reminder options on the configuration form to the 
same interval you plan on using to check for / send reminders.

If you password protect the reminders script file, use this URL
syntax to call the script:

http://user:password@yourdomain.com/calogic/srxclr.php

In order for reminders to work, this file must be run in a browser,
or called from a program that can "act" as a browser, or parsed 
with the PHP interpreter. Any of which must be done at regular intervals.


Browser Method:

Setting up reminders depends first of all, on what web server you have,
and which operating system it runs on.

If you have a Unix / Linux web server, you can use a unix program called
cron, which is a scheduling program. cron is a program that will automatically
run a program at whatever intervals you set. You must check with your
provider to see if you are allowed to use cron. But cron alone, is not enuf.

You also have to have a program that will call the url of the reminders
script from a unix shell. I personally like wget. You can search the internet 
for "wget" and you will find all kinds of information about the program and 
how to get it. Or, you can directly run the program with the php interpreter.

Explaining everything about cron or wget is beyond the scope of this
document. Besides, there is plenty of info on the internet. and it's very
easy to find. But I will do my best to make it understandable for you.

If you have cron available, make sure you set it up to run at the intervals you
set on the CaLogic config form.

using cron is quite simple. you use the unix command crontab to create
a cron control file refered to as the crontab (or cron table).

cron then executes the commands in the crontab file at the specified intervals.

The crontab command options are as follows, these can be run in a unix shell:

crontab -l (thats a small letter L)

display your cron tab.

crontab -r (thats a small letter R)

delete your crontab

crontab -e

edit your crontab


The format for the crontab entries are as follows:

remarks in the crontab are preceded with a pound sign #

each line of the crontab consists of 6 fields seperated with a single space.

Fields 1 thru 5 represent the date and time the command is to be executed.
Field 6 is the actual command.

Field 1  = MINUTE(0-59)
Field 2  = HOUR(0-23)
Field 3  = DAY OF MONTH(1-31)
Field 4  = MONTH OF YEAR(1-12)
Field 5  = DAY OF WEEK(0-6)  Note 0 = Sun

An astrix (*) in any one of the date time field positions means any.
So, for example:

* * * * * command

would execute the command every minute of every hour of every day 
of every month of every week

1 * * * * command
would execute the command when the minute = 1 of every hour 
of every day etc. So basicaly once an hour.

Each date time field can contain more than one value, seperated by commas.

So, to execute a command when the hour is full, and when the hour is at half,
you would enter:

0,30 * * * * command
Which means, when the minute = 0, or the minute = 30 of every hour etc.

To run a command every 5 minutes enter this:

0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * command

I think you have got the idea.

An important point to remember is, the crontab must end with a linefeed.


Here is the crontab I use to run the reminders script on my web using wget:

# lines that begin with a # are remarks
#
# Run CaLogic Reminder every 5 minutes 
#
# the following command should be entered on a single line in the cron tab.
0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * wget -b -o calogic_wget_reminder_log.txt -O calogic_wget_reminder_result.html http://www.yourdomain.com/calogic/srxclr.php
#
# -b is a small letter B, and tells wget to run in background mode
# -o is a small letter O, and tells wget the name of the log file 
# to use, this is wget's log file
# -O is a capitol letter O, and tells wget where to write the output
# of the called URL, in the case of CaLogic, the output is:
# Reminders finished
# n mails sent (where n = the number of mails sent.


With this setup, I can ftp or telnet my web server, and check the contents
of the log and result files. This is the first place you should look if
reminders are not getting sent, or are not acting like you expect. If the log or
result file never show up, then have a look in your web server error logs,
it could be that the crontab is not formated properly.

The log and result files get overwritten with each call of the command.



The documentation for wget is at:

Here are a few links that explain how to use cron and crontab

The reminders scrip is pretty fast. It depends on how many events with reminders
you have. I suggest running the script a maximum of every 5 minutes, and a minimum
of once a day. Setting up a crontab to run any command too often can bog down your
server.


I will give you one more tip, that will help you find out if you have cron and wget
available on your web server:


first, you have to telnet to your server, then, at the command line type this:
(I will write it in capitol letters for readability, but you must use small leters):

CRONTAB -L

and hit enter.

if you get a response similar to "COMMAND NOT FOUND" then you have 
no cron programm available.

So, next type:

wget

and hit enter. if you get a response similar to "COMMAND NOT FOUND" then the 
wget program is not available to you.



So, for windows web server users:

Setting up reminders on a windows server is in my oppinion, much simpler than on
a unix machine. It is as simple as creating a scheduled job that runs the srxclr.php
script using the php interpreter (php.exe). You could also have the scheduler use
wget, as it is also available for the windows platform. But I suggest using the 
php interpreter.

To use wget, the command line would be something like this:

wget -b -o calogic_wget_reminder_log.txt -O calogic_wget_reminder_result.html http://www.yourdomain.com/calogic/srxclr.php

Setup the scheduler to run the command as offten as you set on 
theCaLogic config form.

Of course you first have to download and install the wget program.

How to use the php interpreter depends on which version of
php you are using. I suggest going thru the php docs, search for 
"commandline" and go from there. For the purpose of this example,
I will assume PHP Version 4.2.3

The command line would look like this:

c:\php\cli\php.exe -f d:\inetpub\calogic\srxclr.php

In the above example, "c:\php\cli\" is the path to the cli folder of your php installation. And
"d:\inetpub\calogic\" is the path to your calogic installation.
You must also in the scheduler choose your CaLogic installation folder as the 
"Run program in" folder.


I wish you luck!
