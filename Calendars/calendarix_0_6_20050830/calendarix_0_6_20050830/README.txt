INTRODUCTION
------------
Calendarix is
- a powerful and easy to use calendar based on PHP and MySQL.
- developed under windows environment and tested with IE6.0 and Firefox 1.0 browser but should work on unix platforms too.

Its features include
- multiple calendar views in day, week, month and by categories.

- widely configurable in colors, font and functions.
- search through events for text.
- able to enter events with a repeat event feature.

- approval of events can be enabled/disabled.

Language support is currently Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, Danish, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Indonesian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Turk and Valencian.  If you like this program and would not mind translating the contents, you can just add your translation files in the "cal_languages" folder. Do let me know of your translations.

To use the calendar
- just follow the installation instructions in the section below.
- if you are required to login to view the public calendar, username:'test', password:'testing'.
- for login into the administration, username:'admin', password:'admin'.

-------------
INSTALLATION
-------------
* unzip the file
* Import the "create_cal.sql" in the "admin" folder into your mysqldatabase
  console : mysql -u username -p
	    create calendar; (if necessary change the name)
	    use calendar;
	    source create_cal.sql;
	    quit;
  phpMyAdmin : go to the database and import the sql file.	    

Open "cal_db.inc.php" and check the database references. 
* Check that the database name, database login name, password and host are correct. Make the necessary changes and save the file as "cal_db.inc.php".

Customize the calendar controls with the file "cal_config.inc.php" and the text and colors with the files "default.css", "default.color.php" and "default.menu.css" in the themes folder.

You can customise the login page for calendarix by editing the html files "callogin_top.html" and "callogin_bottom.html".

Change the theme for the calendar display by setting the $theme variable in the cal_config.inc.php file. eg. $theme = 'fire';

Be sure to allow access to the sub-directories under your calendarix path.


---------
UPGRADING
---------
This version is very different from versions 0.5 in look and feel. However, there is no change in the database.  You should be able to work with the same database by simply removing all the old scripts and replacing with this new one.  However, you will have to reconfigure the look and feel of the calendar in the style sheet file "default.css" in the themes folder.

If you are upgrading from older versions 0f 0.6, you only need to replace all the scripts except the database file cal_db.inc.php. Note that some changes have been made on the theme files and they have to be replaced as well. If you have made changes on the theme files or created your own themes, you can do a comparison on the files and add the new attributes.

---------
MINI-CALENDAR
---------
A file "minical.php" is available for providing a mini-calendar to be embedded in website.  It uses overlib support to provide a summary of events in the mini-calendar.  To include the mini-calendar in a page, use the following code:
<?php include("minical.php"); ?>

However, note that the mini-calendar also relies on the files used by Calendarix so they are put in the same path.  Edit the include paths in "minical.php" if you wish to move the "minical.php" to another location.  

You may want to delete "minical.php" if you do not use it as it can be called by users directly to view the mini-calendar.
