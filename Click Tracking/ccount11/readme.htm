<p>DESCRIPTION</p>

<p>Ccount is a PHP click counter. With its help you can count clicks on any link
on your website. A great tool if you want to know how many times a link has been
clicked, a file downloaded and similar. You can also hide your affiliate links
with PHP click counter. As long as it's a link - Ccount can count clicks on it!</p>

<hr>

<p>Requirements</p>

<ul>
    <li>UNIX or Windows server (it *might* work on others too)</li>
    <li>PHP4 support</li>
    <li>FTP access and a FTP program</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><b>&gt;&gt; Quick installation</b></p>

<p>Open file settings.php in your favorite <b>PLAIN TEXT</b> editor (like Notepad or
Wordpad on Windows systems, DO NOT use MS Word or similar editor) and set these variables:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>$settings['system']</b> - set to 1 if your website is on a server under Linux (most servers are),
set to 2 if it is under Windows (your SERVER, not your computer!). If you are not
sure which operating system your server runs under
try with $settings['system'] set to 1 first or consult your web hosting company.
If you are under some other OS (not Linux nor Win)
you can try setting it from 1 to 3 and see if it works<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['apass']</b> - this will be your password for the admin panel. Change it from the
default password <b>admin</b>. Use only letters a-Z, A-Z and numbers 0-9<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['click_url']</b> - set this variable to the URL of the click.php
file as it will be installed on your
server, for example: http://www.yourdomain.com/ccount/click.php</li>
</ul>

<p>Save and close the settings.php file. There are some more options in the settings.php
file, set them if you are an advanced user only.</p>

<p>Go to your FTP client and FTP to the public
directory on your server (where the rest
of your website is; usually &quot;public_html&quot;, &quot;www&quot; or &quot;site&quot;)
and create
a folder where you will install Ccount.<br>
Example: /public_html/ccount<br>
Corresponding URL: http://www.yourdomain.com/ccount</p>

<p>Upload all Ccount files to this folder. Images (line.gif,reset.gif,delete.gif)
must be transferred in BINARY mode, other files in ASCII mode (refer to your FTP client
instructions for details on how to set transfer mode properly).</p>

<p>Make sure that the PHP scripts have permission to write to files clicks.txt and
ids.txt - on UNIX (Linux) servers you must CHMOD (set permissions for) these two
files to 666 (rw-rw-rw).</p>

<p>If you have done all this your script should work now. In your browser open
folder where you have installed Ccount, for example:<br>
http://www.yourdomain.com/ccount</p>

<p>Type in the password you set in settings.php, click Enter admin panel and voila,
you are in the admin panel! Things should be easy from now on. Use the form Add a link
to add links you wish to count clicks on and follow instructions.</p>

<p><b>Upgrading from CCount version 1.0</b></p>

<p>If you are upgrading from CCount version <b>1.0</b> note that the two
databases ARE COMPATIBLE. This means you can keep all your old links!
To upgrade from 1.0 to this version upload all files from this zip file
over the old CCount files <b>except</b> clicks.txt and ids.txt! You should use
your ODL clicks.txt and ids.txt files if you want to keep your existing links.</p>

<p>Good luck with the script!</p>

<p><b>&gt;&gt; Displaying number of clicks on a link</b></p>

<p>CCount from version 1.1 on allows you to display the number of clicks on a link
at your website. To display number of clicks on your web page follow these two steps:</p>

<p><b>1.</b> Add this code in your HTML document HEAD (paste it somewhere between &lt;head&gt;
and &lt;/head&gt; HTML tags):</p>

<p><b>&lt;script language=&quot;Javascript&quot;
src=&quot;http://www.domain.com/ccount/display.php&quot;&gt;<br>
&lt;!--<br>
//--&gt;<br>
&lt;/script&gt;</b></p>

<p>CHANGE http://www.domain.com/ccount/display.php to the URL of display.php
on your server!</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Add this code where you want the number of clicks to appear:</p>

<p><b>&lt;script language=&quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;ccount_display('LINK_ID')&lt;/script&gt;</b></p>

<p>REPLACE LINK_ID with the ID number of the link you want to display the count for
(IDs can be found when you login to CCount admin panel)! To display number of clicks
on the link with ID 13 you would use this code:</p>

<p>&lt;script language=&quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;ccount_display('<b>13</b>')&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<p>You may add any HTML tags around this code to format the count number. This
code for example:<br><br>
Link 9 has been clicked &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;&lt;script
language=&quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;ccount_display('9')&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
times<br><br>
would produce such output:<br><br>
Link 9 has been clicked <font color="#FF0000">478</font> times</p>

<p>If you get an <b>undefined</b> error instead of a number please double-check
the ID number you entered in the code above!</p>

<hr>

<p><b>&gt;&gt; Troubleshooting</b></p>

<p><b>What is CHMOD and FTP?</b></p>

<p>I have prepared a simple <a href="http://www.phpjunkyard.com/ftp-chmod-tutorial.php" target="_blank">
FTP and CHMOD tutorial</a> which will help you FTP files to your server and
set correct CHMOD settings.</p>

<p><b>My counter doesn't work, HELP!</b></p>

<p>Ok, first of all don't panic, it's only a counter :-) Here are a few things to
check:</p>
<ol>
<li>did you upload all files except images in ASCII mode?</li>
<li>are clicks.txt and ids.txt files world writable? CHMOD them to 666 (rw-rw-rw) if you are on a UNIX server</li>
</ol>

<p>Since these scripts are free no support is guaranteed. If you can't get the script to work please go
through this readme file again carefully and repeat the installation step-by-step (also delete old
files and folders from the server). Also please feel free to post any questions or problems you might have
in <a href="http://developers.phpjunkyard.com">PHPJunkyard forum</a>!</p>
